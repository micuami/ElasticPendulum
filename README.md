The goals of this project are:
1. Implementation of the nonlinear mathematical model of an elastic pendulum using the Matlab function block in a Simulink scheme, analysis of step response and error evaluation.
2. Illustration of the static characteristic of the mathematical model using the Matlab block, approximation of answers using the polynomials p1 and p2, and the polyval function and approximation of the steady-state responses.
3. Determination a static operating point so that the error is minimal.
4. Determination of the state space system, defined by the matrix quadruple, as a result of the linearization
at the static operating point and obtaining a stable system.
5. Calculation of the time response of the linearized system
at the step input.
6. Calculate of the response of the nonlinear system to the step input and determination of the linearization error. 
7. Discretization of the linearized model.
